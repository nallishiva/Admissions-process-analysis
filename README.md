As I'm a Data Analyst working for a university, and my task is to analyze the admissions
process. The Admissions Office wants to understand key trends, applicant performance, and
the effectiveness of communication strategies. Based on my analysis, you will present
actionable insights to streamline the process and improve conversions from applications to
enrollments.

Objectives
1. Data Preparation
○ Clean and preprocess the provided datasets.
○ Establish relationships between datasets using the ApplicationID field.
2. Data Analysis and Insights
○ Analyze the admissions funnel (applications → interviews → enrollment).
○ Identify demographic trends (e.g., top-performing cities, age group analysis).
○ Evaluate applicant performance in interviews and aptitude tests.
○ Assess the impact of communication channels and response times on
conversion rates.
3. Visualizations
○ Create an interactive Power BI dashboard with the following:
■ Admissions Funnel: Visualize the number of applicants at each
stage (applications, interviews, and enrollments).
■ Demographic Analysis: Charts for age, gender, and geographic
trends.
■ Performance Metrics: Interview and aptitude score trends by
program or department.
■ Communication Efficiency: Insights into response times and
channel effectiveness.
4. Advanced Calculations (DAX)
○ Calculate:
■ Average interview score by department.
■ Conversion rate: Applicants → Enrolled.
■ Average response time for each communication channel.

5. Recommendations
○ Provide actionable strategies to improve the admissions process based on
the data.
○ Suggest ways to target underperforming demographics or improve
communication efficiency.
